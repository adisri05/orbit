🚀 ORBIT — Event-Driven Learning Platform
ORBIT is an event-driven learning platform that models learning as behavior, not checklists.
It captures learning actions as immutable events and builds progress, analytics, and recommendations as derived intelligence on top.


Core idea:
Events → State → Insights → Decisions → UI


🧠 Why ORBIT Exists
Most learning apps:
hardcode progress
calculate logic in the frontend
tightly couple features


ORBIT does the opposite:
treats learning as a stream of events
separates facts from interpretation
keeps intelligence layered, explainable, and replay-safe

This makes the system scalable, debuggable, and production-grade.
